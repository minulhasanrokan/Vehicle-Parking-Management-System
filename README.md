# VehicleParking-management-System
This PHP vehicle parking management system project primarily focuses on keeping track of vehicles. Additionally, the system displays all of the vehicle's entry and exit records. The system also allows the addition of vehicle categories. The project contains only an admin panel. A view of this web application shows that an administrator has total control over the system. An administrator assists in maintaining the system's flow. Administrators can add vehicle categories by providing category names. The admin can simply insert the vehicle's entry after managing the vehicle categories. Here, he/she needs to enter the vehicle's number, model name, category, and owner's information.
